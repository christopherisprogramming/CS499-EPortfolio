# CS-499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio

This repository contains my ePortfolio for the CS-499 Computer Science Capstone at Southern New Hampshire University. It includes enhanced technical artifacts and written narratives that demonstrate my growth and mastery in key areas of computer science:

- Software Design and Engineering  
- Algorithms and Data Structures  
- Databases
