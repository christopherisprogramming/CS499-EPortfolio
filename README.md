# CS499-EPortfolio

This portfolio showcases selected projects and enhancements from my Computer Science degree at SNHU. It includes artifact enhancements in three key areas:

- Software Design and Engineering  
- Algorithms and Data Structures  
- Databases

Each enhancement is paired with a written narrative describing the process, skills demonstrated, and connections to course outcomes.
